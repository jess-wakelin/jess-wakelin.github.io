# Portfolio

This portfolio started as a university assignment but has bene maintained and updated to reflect me today


## Todo list

1. ~~alter "CONTACT ME" section~~
    - ~~the section doesn't work as it seems~~
    - ~~the contact form is an illusion for the purpose of the assignment, this projects original goal~~
    - ~~replace the form with more prominent socials and email~~
    - ~~done with flexbox, try with bootstrap styles?~~

1. ~~update experience section~~
    - ~~include new skills and education~~
    - ~~rewrite personal paragraph~~
    
1. update portfolio
    - include new projects that have been undertaken
        - unity projects
        - web development (vue project, php projects)
        - C# netcat clone
        - java car rental system
        - bash blackjack game

1. small things
    - ~~footer copyright~~ 
    - bigger socials means small ones are unnecessary

    - ~~not studying - graduated~~
    - change dark mode to default
    - change switch to be more intuitive
    - change titles to be bigger
