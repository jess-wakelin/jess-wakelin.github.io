# Portfolio

This portfolio started as a university assignment but has bene maintained and updated to reflect me today


## Todo list
    
1. add to portfolio
    - unity projects
    - web development (vue project, ~~php projects~~)

1. small things
    - bigger socials means small ones are unnecessary
    - change dark mode to default
    - change switch to be more intuitive
    - ~~change titles to be bigger~~
    - nav accent with upscaled label is out of line on hamburger menu
    - redo portfolio pictures for better quality
    - increase size of github icon in portfolio
    

1. testing
    - redo testing toward end of this list
    - improve responsiveness
    - clean up older code

1. known bugs
    - browsing portfolio starting with first one in a line is fine   
    starting with 2nd or 3rd in a line means that the portfolio cannot be closed
